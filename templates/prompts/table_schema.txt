1. you output a python dict describing the data in step 4
2. the python dict output should contain the key names for each field, along with their inferred data types of the list elements: vector, id, idset, string, stringset, int, bool, or decimal(n). you do not include values of the keys in the dict, but their type instead.
3. Consider the data types in step 2. as you evaluate the data in step 4: 
    a list of strings are simple type string, which are "quoted". 
    a list of integers are int.
    a list of string lists is a stringset.
    a list of whole number lists is an idset.
    a list of integer lists is a vector.
    a list of floats or decimals with precision are decimal(n) type. where n equals the preceision of the decimal value: for example, decimal(2) for 1.24 or decimal(5) for 1.12345.
    a list of float lists should be a vector
    a list of true or false values is bool type.
    null or none or a list of null or none should be excluded from the resultant python dict you are creating.
4. evaluate the following python dictionary and determine the data types. in step 5.

5. output a key for the key's name, plus the datatype as a string:
