# complete create dict task
1. The user has entered the following query. This is what the user actually typed in:
"""
$query
""".
2. The user has selected the "$table_name" table. That table has the following schema:
"""
table_name=$table_name
$columns
"""
3. Determine if the query contains SQL or fragments of SQL based on the schema in step 2.
4. Determine if the query is plain text. If it is plain text, think about an augmented user query:
"""
The user appears to be searching for "$query", which if it isn't SQL, can probably be found by running the embedding on the query and doing cosine distances on the database entries:
SELECT _id, cosine_distance(\{embedding\}, embedding) FROM $table_name;
$query
"""
4. build a dict with "query", "suggested_sql", and "explain" keys:
# "query" is the user's query, which is "$query"
# "sql" is an interpretation of the correct SQL for satifying the user's input query
# "explain" provides an explaination for why you generated the required dictionary
