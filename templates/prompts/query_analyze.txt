# complete create dict task
1. The user has entered the following query:
"""
$query
""".
2. The user has selected the "$table_name" table. That table has the following schema:
"""
table_name=$table_name
$columns
"""
3. Determine if the query contains fragments of sql and complete a suggested sql query:
# build a dict with "is_sql", "query", "suggested_sql" and "explain" keys:
# if you determine this is a search, not sql, generate a search using the following format:
# SELECT _id, cosine_distance(\{embedding\}, embedding) FROM <insert_table_name>;
# "explain" provides an explaination for why you generated the required dictionary
