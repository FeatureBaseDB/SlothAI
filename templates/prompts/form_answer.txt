"""
"Christopher Robin, you must shoot the balloon with your gun. Have you
got your gun?" "Of course I have," you said. "But if I do that, it will spoil the
balloon," you said. "But if you _don't_," said Pooh, "I shall have to let go, and that would
spoil _me_." When he put it like this, you saw how it was, and you aimed very
carefully at the balloon, and fired.

# Create a python dictionary with the question and answer, plus a "word lock on" of a key words in the text in EXAMPLE_TEXT., which helps answer the question.
# pdf_meta = {"question": "What was used and by what means allowed Winnie-the-Pooh to escape the bees?", "answer": "Winnie-the-Pooh used a balloon, and he allowed himself to escape by having Christopher Robin 
shoot the balloon with his gun.", "word_lock_on": "shoot the balloon with your gun"}

1. As in the example, read the content in step 2 and build a python dictionary to answer the question in step 3 as well as find a "word lock on" of keywords that can be found in the text in step 2.
2. The the PDF titled "$title" contains the following text:
TEXT = """
$text
"""
3. Create a python dictionary with the question and answer, plus a "word lock on" of a key words in the text in step 2., which helps answer the question: $question
# complete the Python dict and ensure "word_lock_on" is pulled from the TEXT in step 2.
pdf_meta = {"question": "$question",
