{# Use this template to build a write to FeatureBase processor! #}

{# Write processors for FeatureBase need a table name. #}
extras = [{'table': '[user_extra]'}]

{# Send the entire document to the 'steve' table: #}
{{task.document}}

{# Unless they are the last node, write processors will pass task.document to the next node in the pipeline... #}
