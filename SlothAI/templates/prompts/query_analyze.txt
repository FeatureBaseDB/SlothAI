# complete create dict task
1. The user has entered the following query. This is what the user actually typed in:
"""
$query
""".
2. The user has selected the "$table_name" table. That table has the following schema:
"""
table_name=$table_name
$columns
"""
3. For key "explain", is there a <good_reason> to believe you can safely rewrite the SQL using the schema in step 2?
4. For key "rewrite", do you believe the SQL can safely be rewritten using the schema in step 2?
4. For key "sql", does the query contains valid SQL?
5. Write a python dictionary to respond:
# examples
# "safe" things are things like "selects", but not like "drop"
# python_dict = {"explain": "Can't be written to SQL because <good_reason>", "sql": "false", "rewrite": "false"}
# python_dict = {"explain": "It is valid SQL because <good_reason>", "sql": "true", "rewrite": "true"}
# python_dict = {"explain": "It isn't valid SQL, but it can be rewritten", "sql": "false", "rewrite": "true"}
python_dict =
