# form an example

1. Consider an example input. The input_fields for the `jinja2` processor example's pipeline were as follows:
"""
[{'name': "text", 'type': "strings"}]
"""

2. Review this example output as a result of attention in 1.:
"""
curl -X POST \
"http://localhost:8080/pipeline/1L7lirUMUP4UU/task?token=VBtQYnXjdPsGBM0hifAqePy9Ef2kXPWYChWnNO" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text":["There was a knock at the door, then silence."]}'
"""

3. As you can see, the array in step 1. describes the name of the field in the -d string, as well as indicating what type of value is used there, such as a list of strings

3. We have a new pipeline with the following input_fields using the `$head_processor` processor:
"""
$head_input_fields
"""

4. Finish the sample below by providing the string passed to -d. Do not restate or show anything but the string surrounded by single quotes ('):
curl -X POST \
"http://localhost:8080/pipeline/$pipe_id/task?token=$user_api_token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d
